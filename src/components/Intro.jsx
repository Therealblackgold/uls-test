              After realizing that in this industry, every company is doing
              things the same way, lack of innovation in the industry was the
              birth of Upper Level Security.
            </p>
            <p className="lead" data-aos="fade-up">
              The founder of the company (Mohau Richard Mokoena) started working
              in the security industry as a security guard, thats when the
              desire to improve the standard of private security was realised,
              and as a strong believer in trustworthy and honest customer
              service, things played out.
            </p>
            <p className="lead" data-aos="fade-up">
              The need for that service was realized and Upper Level Security
              came to be.
            </p>
            <p className="lead" data-aos="zoom-in">
              Our previous clients include big and small organizations whom that
              we have served with pride without compromising the standard of
              service because safety is our priority.
